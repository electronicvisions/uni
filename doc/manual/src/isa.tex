\chapter{Instruction set}

This chapter specifies the execution model for programs and the format of byte-code.


\section{Execution model}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:dataflow} shows the flow of data within the \gls{uni} execution model.
There is an encode and a decode path.
The encode path takes byte-code as input, decodes the contained instructions and issues them either to the timing or the execution unit.

The timing unit handles all aspects of temporal control: setting of the global system timer and specifying the execution time for the next operation send to the execution unit.
The global system timer $T$ is a \unit[64]{bit} counter that increments in each clock cycle.
The timing unit can initialize this $T$.
The timestamp register $S$, specifies the execution time for the next operation in the execution unit.
Operations are only executed when the timer condition $S \ge T$ is true.

The execution unit converts generic \gls{uni} instructions to specific data frames for the back-end.
The timed-release block forwards frame data to the mixer and thereby the hardware when the timer condition is met.
It also pushes an entry into the synchronization \gls{fifo} if necessary.
For example a read request pushes its address into the \gls{fifo}, so that the decode path can provide this address together with the result data, when the response arrives from hardware.

The decode path converts data frames from hardware into valid byte-code including timing information using the global system timer.
Read instructions in the program are converted to write instructions in the result stream and vice versa.
The data part of the write then corresponds to the returned data from the read request.
The main reason for this is to avoid treating result data differently from program data in software and hardware.
It might also be interesting to reapply result data as program.

\textbf{Note:} So far, mixer and monitor have not been implemented.
The mixer merges data frame streams from timed release and an external port using a suitable arbitration scheme.
The monitor copies data frames to an external port.
This approach allows additional back-end specific logic to realize recurrent connections by connecting to these external ports.
They are positioned after and before buffering \glspl{fifo} respectively to minimize latency.



\section{Byte-code definition}

Instructions are one or more bytes, i.e.\ \unit[8]{bit}, long.
The first byte specifies the operation, while the remaining bytes are data.


\subsection{Implementation defined functions}

To map the generic instructions to the specific back-end two functions are to be defined by the implementation:
\begin{description}
    \item[$\text{\sc{io}}(a)$]
        Represents the contents of the \gls{io} space location at address $a$.
        This could for example be the contents of a configuration register that is addressed with the given address.

    \item[$\text{\sc{fire}}(i, a)$]
        Trigger a spike event for target $i$.
        Each event has also an address $a$.
\end{description}



\subsection{Timing control instructions}

\subsubsection{Set global system timer}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{72}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,71} \\
    \bitbox{8}{$0000 0000$} & \bitbox{64}{$t$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{SET_TIME}}
{\footnotesize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $T \gets t$
\end{algorithmic} }
Set the global system timer $T$ to the specified value $t$.
The most significant bit of $t$ is at position 8.


\subsubsection{Wait until}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{72}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,71} \\
    \bitbox{8}{$0000 0000$} & \bitbox{64}{$t$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{WAIT_UNTIL}}
{\footnotesize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $S \gets t$
\end{algorithmic} }
Set the timestamp $S$ to the specified value $t$.
The most significant bit of $t$ is at position 8.
This delays the next instruction for the execution unit to the time $t$.


\subsubsection{Wait for}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{8}
    \bitheader{0,1,7} \\
    \bitbox{1}{$1$} & \bitbox{7}{$t$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{WAIT_FOR_7}}
\vspace{2em}

\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{24}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,23} \\
    \bitbox{8}{$0000 0100$} & \bitbox{16}{$t$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{WAIT_FOR_16}}
\vspace{2em}

\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{40}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,39} \\
    \bitbox{8}{$0000 0101$} & \bitbox{32}{$t$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{WAIT_FOR_32}}
\vspace{2em}

{\footnotesize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $S \gets S + t$
\end{algorithmic} }
Increment timestamp $S$ by the specified amount $t$.
The most significant bit of $t$ is at position 1.
This delays the next instruction for the execution unit to the new value of the timestamp register.


\subsection{Configuration instructions}


\subsubsection{Write}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{72}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,39,40,71} \\

\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{WRITE}}
{\footnotesize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \State $\Call{io}{a} \gets d$
\end{algorithmic} }
Write to back-end address space.
This creates a matching \code{READ} instruction in the result stream with address $a$.


\subsubsection{Read}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=0.6em]{40}
    \bitheader{0,7,8,39} \\
    \bitbox{8}{$0000 1011$} & \bitbox{32}{$a$} \\
\end{bytefield} \\
\textbf{\code{READ}}
{\footnotesize
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

    \For{ $0 \le i < 64$ }
        \If{s[i] = 1}
            \State \Call{fire}{i,a}
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
\end{algorithmic} }

All events have the address $a$.
